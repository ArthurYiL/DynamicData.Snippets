# Dynamic Data Snippets

People are always asking me for documents or explanations of dynamic data. However as an open source developer and active family man who works in a high pressure environment, the maintenance and development of my open source projects leaves me with no time to even consider documents.  

Thinking about it, why do people always ask for documents. We are developers and we can write and analyse code better than we can produce documents (well most of us anyway).  That is why I have created this project, with the aim to:

 - Regard this project as a '101 Samples project'
 - Ensure all examples are unit tested
 - The unit tests have the benefit that anyone can debug and use the project as a playground
 - Respond to queries from the community by adding new examples to the project
 
### Support And Contact

The dynamic data chat room is a sub channel the Reactive Inc slack channel. It is an invite only forum so if you want an invite send me a message on roland_pheasant@hotmail.com
  
### Real world examples of Dynamic Data

I have created several Dynamic Data in action projects which illustrates the usage of dynamic data. I encourage people who want to see these real world examples to take a look at the following projects to see the capabilities of Dynamic Data.

Include are:

[Dynamic Trader](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/Dynamic.Trader) which is an example of how Dynamic Data can handle fast moving high throughput trading data with. It illustrates some of the core operators of dynamic data and how a single data source can be shared and shaped in various ways. It also includes an example of how it can be integrated with ReactiveUI.

[TailBlazer](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/TailBlazer) is a popular file tail utility which is an example of Rx and Dynamic Data and I consider to be a celebration of reactive programming. It is an advanced example of how to achieve high performance and how to lean on Rx and Dynamic Data to produce a slick and response user interface.

[DynamicData Samplz](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData.Samplz) where I started to do some visual examples but abandoned the project because I decided that the snippets project would be a better means of providing quick to produce examples. However there are still several good examples so well worth taking a look.
